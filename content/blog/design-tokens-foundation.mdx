summary: How CSS custom properties and design tokens create maintainable, themeable design systems.

I used to hardcode colors, spacing, and typography values directly in components. It was fast, but changing a color meant updating 20 files. Design tokens solve this by creating a single source of truth for design decisions.

## What Are Design Tokens?

Design tokens are named values that represent design decisions: colors, spacing, typography, shadows, borders. They're stored as CSS custom properties (variables) and TypeScript constants.

```css
:root {
  --color-interactive-default: #0066cc;
  --spacing-4: 1rem;
  --font-size-base: 1rem;
}
```

## Why They Matter

**Consistency**: Using `var(--spacing-4)` everywhere ensures spacing is consistent. If you need to adjust it, change it in one place.

**Theming**: Switch themes by changing token values. Dark mode becomes trivial—just swap the token definitions.

**Type safety**: Export tokens as TypeScript constants, and you get autocomplete and type checking.

**Framework agnostic**: CSS custom properties work in React, Vue, vanilla JS, anywhere CSS works.

## Implementation Strategy

Start with the basics: colors, spacing, typography. Add shadows, borders, and animations as needed.

```typescript
// tokens.ts
export const spacingTokens = {
  1: "0.25rem",
  2: "0.5rem",
  4: "1rem",
  // ...
} as const;
```

Then generate CSS from these tokens, or define them directly in CSS. I prefer defining in CSS and importing TypeScript constants for JavaScript usage.

## The Result

A design system where changing a primary color updates the entire UI, where spacing is consistent without thinking about it, and where new developers can understand the design language by reading the tokens file.

Tokens aren't just variables—they're the contract between design and code.
