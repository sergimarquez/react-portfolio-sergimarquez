As a front-end developer, one of the first lessons you learn is how to calculate and handle CSS specificity.
At first, styling with specificity feels logical and clean—until you start working on a large project and discover the dreaded specificity wars.

You end up adding !important, nesting inside already enormous selectors, and fighting the DevTools just to figure out where a simple color is coming from. Eventually, you might even give up on the CSS architecture altogether, because refactoring feels impossible.

I wish every lesson about specificity came with a side note: **avoid it whenever you can.**

**Make your CSS predictable, not specific.**

By predictable, I mean this: when you write CSS to make a button blue, it should be blue everywhere it's used. You shouldn't be surprised by where it works—or doesn't—and you shouldn't need to override it just to get the expected result.

```css
/* ❌ specific, contextual */
.page .card button.primary {
  background: blue;
}

.modal .card button.primary {
  background: red;
}

/* ✅ predictable, explicit */
.button {
  background: var(--color-primary);
}

.button--secondary {
  background: var(--color-secondary);
}
```

With modern CSS, we have plenty of tools and patterns available to make our styles predictable instead of fragile.

A few simple strategies go a long way:

- Keep selectors simple
- Avoid contextual overrides
- Aim for class-only selectors
- Minimise nesting
- Use explicit variants instead of overrides

Predictable CSS comes from low, consistent selectors, composition over context, minimal nesting, and explicit variants. Use specificity rarely and intentionally.

The goal isn't zero specificity. Specificity is useful—but only when it's intentional and when it's needed.

When writing CSS, you shouldn't be asking, "How do I override this?"

You should be asking, "Why doesn't my input produce the expected result?"
