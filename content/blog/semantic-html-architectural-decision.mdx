I see semantic HTML treated as an afterthought in most projects.

We know it helps SEO, accessibility, and code maintainability.
But we treat it as "nice to have," not critical.

Then you realize your apps are scoring very poorly on SEO and accessibility. Fixing it means reworking entire design systems or components.

That's when semantic HTML becomes an architectural concern.

## A Simple Example

A common mistake I see is using divs as buttons for styling reasons:

```html
<div onclick="save()">Save</div>
```

At first glance, it works. Looks fine.

But when you use a `<div>` instead, you're ditching some built-in behavior and taking on all that responsibility yourself.

And now every place that follows this pattern has to do the same.

When you write this instead:

```html
<button>Save</button>
```

You're not just choosing an element.
You're saying: **this is interactive, it can receive focus, it works with a keyboard, and assistive technologies know what it is.**

## Why Semantic HTML Matters at Scale

In small apps, this doesn't feel like a big deal.

In larger systems, the pattern repeats. One component copies another. A design system or component library is built that way.

I've seen design systems where the Button component was built on a `<div>`. Now every button across 200+ components needs to be refactored. Suddenly, entire pages inherit low accessibility and SEO issues.

All of a sudden, you find yourself rewriting components, updating interactions, and fixing accessibility across dozens of places — far more costly than doing it right from the start.

## Semantic HTML Is More Than Markup

We have to think about semantic HTML as a tool for good architecture.

The good thing about HTML is that it provides a lot of constraints and features by default.

A `<button>` will always behave like a button.
A clickable `<div>` can forget everything.

I've worked on components where someone used a `<div>` for a clickable card. Later, we needed keyboard navigation. Then focus management. Then proper ARIA roles. Each feature required more JavaScript and more complexity.

If they'd used `<article>` or `<section>` from the start, the browser would have handled most of it.

When we choose elements that prevent entire classes of bugs, this good pattern propagates, and our app becomes more reliable and scalable.

## Takeaway

Semantic HTML should be more than just an afterthought.

It should act like **the skeleton of your app**, forming the foundation on which everything else is built.

Not just for accessibility, SEO, or maintainability — but as a tool to build scalable, reliable front-end architectures.
