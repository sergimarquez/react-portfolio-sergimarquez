I'm picky about dependencies. Every library adds complexity, maintenance burden, and bundle size. But these seven? I install them on every project. Here's why.

## 1. React Query (TanStack Query)

I used to write `useState` + `useEffect` for every API call. Then I'd add loading states, error handling, retry logic, caching... React Query does all of that, and it's battle-tested.

The real win? Background refetching. Your data stays fresh without user interaction. Stale-while-revalidate caching means instant renders with background updates. It's like having a smart cache that just works.

```typescript
const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["user", userId],
  queryFn: () => fetchUser(userId),
  staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
});
```

I've replaced hundreds of lines of boilerplate with this pattern.

## 2. Zod

TypeScript catches errors at compile time. Zod catches them at runtime. When an API response doesn't match what you expect—and it won't—Zod validates it and gives you a clear error.

I use it for API responses, form validation, environment variables, and configuration. It's saved me from production bugs more times than I can count.

## 3. React Hook Form

Forms are annoying. React Hook Form makes them less annoying. It's performant (no re-renders on every keystroke), has great TypeScript support, and integrates with Zod for validation.

The API is clean, the bundle is small, and it handles complex forms without breaking a sweat. I've built multi-step wizards, dynamic field arrays, and conditional validation—all with minimal code.

## 4. date-fns

I used Moment.js for years. Then I saw the bundle size. date-fns is modular (tree-shakeable), has a better API, and is actively maintained. It's become my go-to for anything date-related.

## 5. clsx

Tiny utility for conditional classNames. I use it everywhere:

```typescript
clsx("base-class", isActive && "active", variant === "primary" && "primary");
```

It's 200 bytes, has perfect TypeScript support, and makes dynamic styling readable. There's no reason not to use it.

## 6. React Testing Library

If you're testing React, you should use this. It tests behavior, not implementation. Your tests survive refactors because they test what users see, not how components work internally.

I've seen too many test suites break because someone changed a component's internal structure. RTL tests don't care about that.

## 7. next-mdx-remote

I'm using it for this blog. MDX lets you write React components in Markdown. `next-mdx-remote` makes it easy to render MDX from any source (files, CMS, database).

It's perfect for blogs, documentation, or any content-heavy site. The developer experience is great, and the output is fast.

## My Filter

Before adding any library, I ask:

1. Does it solve a real problem I have?
2. Is it actively maintained?
3. What's the bundle size?
4. Does it have good TypeScript support?

If a library adds more complexity than it removes, I skip it. These seven pass that test every time.

What's in your essential stack?
