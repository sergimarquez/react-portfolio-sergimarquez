## Why performance matters

Speed affects perception, engagement, and business outcomes. I treat it as part of the product, not an afterthought.

## Techniques

- Establish budgets early and monitor regressions
- Lean on code splitting, lazy loading, and prefetching
- Measure in lab and field using Lighthouse + RUM

## Result

Teams focus on features, knowing the performance guardrails catch regressions before they reach users.
