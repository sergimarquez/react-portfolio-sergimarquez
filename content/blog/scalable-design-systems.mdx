## Why Design Systems Matter

A design system is more than a component library. It's the interface between design and engineering, enabling shared language, tooling, and velocity.

## My Process

1. Discover constraints with product, design, and engineering.
2. Define tokens, primitives, and composition rules.
3. Document usage through Storybook, ADRs, and examples.
4. Automate linting, visual tests, and changelog entries.

## Lessons Learned

- Treat tokens as source of truth for theming and multi-platform work.
- Provide guardrails, not gates: allow deviation with documented rationale.
- Invest in education: office hours, pair sessions, and playbooks.

## Results

Teams ship faster, designers trust implementation, and maintenance cost drops.
